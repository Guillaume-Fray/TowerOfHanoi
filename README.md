# TowerOfHanoi
Design and Implementation of a Robotic System to enable a robot (Baxter) to solve a puzzle, using ROS and Python.

Tools:
    . OpenCV library
    . Numpy library
    . ROS

In this project the robot plays and interacts with someone to solve the tower of hanoi. Baxter must indicate what the best possible move is to the player by pointing first its end effector towards the ring to move, then towards the pole where the ring must be moved to.
The project includes:
  . Face detection
  . Colour blob detection
  . Speech-to-text
  . Text-to-speech
  . AI algorithm (to solve the puzzle)
  . Forward Kinematics
